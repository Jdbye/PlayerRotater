# Player Rotater (Desktop Only)
Allows you to rotate yourself around where you can even replicate the spiderman kissing scene.

As you get rotated away from where you are you will have to fly too, to adjust yours position back.

It'll use EmmVRC Black/Whitelisting and check world tags too for games

Does need UIExpansionKit


## Controls
WASD as usual flying, E Up and Q Down

Arrow Keys to rotate yourself around


## Controls VR
Left Thumbstick/pad for flying and hold right trigger to go up/down with right thumbstick/pad in VR

Right thumbstick/thumbpad but without holding right trigger to rotate around in VR

~~Apparently it doesn't fully work in VR and just turns into a spin mod.~~
