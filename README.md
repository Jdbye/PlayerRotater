# Player Rotater
Allows you to rotate yourself around where you can even replicate the spiderman kissing scene.

Can change the rotation origin around either your hips (camera viewpoint for generic avatars) or camera viewpoint at all times

It'll use EmmVRC Black/Whitelisting and check world tags too for games

Does need UIExpansionKit
